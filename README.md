This is web-clicker with registration-system (with mail check). With login and also saving game data on server in DB. I attached chat in game, builded on secure web sockets (wss). For that i used workerman. I used composer for php. Threw a project on a half-way because it was too difficult for me. Clicker had potential but i was too young for it))

Used: jQuery; PHP; MYSQL.

Approximate volumes: 2.37k lines of code.
